In computing, a regular expression, also referrred to as 'regex' or 'regexp', provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, 
such as particular characters, words or patterns of characters.

A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.
They are really clever 'wild-card' expressions for matching and parsing strings.
